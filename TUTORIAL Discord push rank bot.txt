Preparation done. Now you need to setup the bot configuration
Setup bot
Get your discord token, different ways:

First method:

Open your browser and activate developer mode
Login your discord account
Go to developer mode and click on XHR tab
Find login request and click
Go to Responses tab and find token value
Copy that token
Second method:

Make sure that you already login into your discord account
Go to Developers tool in your browser
Find javascript console, and paste code below:
(
    webpackChunkdiscord_app.push(
        [
            [''],
            {},
            e => {
                m=[];
                for(let c in e.c)
                    m.push(e.c[c])
            }
        ]
    ),
    m
).find(
    m => m?.exports?.default?.getToken !== void 0
).exports.default.getToken()
Copy the result from console, that's your discord token
Edit config.ini file:

Open config.ini file with your favorites text editor
Find TOKEN variable and paste token value that you got earlier
The rest of configuration is self-explanatory so i don't need to reiterate it here
Note: you can go to wordlist directory and change the message that you want to send, each of the message should be separated by double enter

python dc.py
Then go to the server that you want to run the bot in, type gm to start the bot
